# 🎉 Webhook Integration Complete!

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. **Enhanced Database Model with Event History** 📊

#### Added to DynamoDB:
- ✅ `mxInvoiceId` - MX Merchant invoice ID
- ✅ `mxInvoiceNumber` - Invoice number from MX Merchant
- ✅ `eventHistory` - Array tracking all status changes with metadata

#### Event History Structure:
```json
{
  "eventType": "invoice.paid",
  "status": "completed",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-10T14:30:00Z",
  "source": "mx_merchant_webhook",
  "description": "Payment completed - $487.50",
  "metadata": {
    "transactionId": "txn_abc123",
    "paymentMethod": "Visa - 4242",
    "paidAmount": 487.50,
    "balance": 0,
    "invoiceNumber": "INV-2025-001"
  }
}
```

### 2. **Enhanced Webhook Handler Logging** 📝

#### New Emoji-Prefixed Logs:
```
📥 WEBHOOK RECEIVED    - Webhook event received
✅ EVENT: Completed    - Payment completed
❌ EVENT: Failed       - Payment failed
💰 EVENT: Partial      - Partial payment
🚫 EVENT: Cancelled    - Invoice cancelled
📤 EVENT: Sent         - Invoice sent (Unpaid)
⚠️ EVENT: Unknown      - Unknown event type
💾 DATABASE            - Database update
📝 HISTORY             - Event history update
📱 SMS                 - SMS notification
```

#### What Gets Logged:
- Complete webhook payload (raw data)
- Event type mapping (MX event → internal status)
- Database updates (old status → new status)
- SMS notifications (sent/failed/skipped)
- Event history additions
- Error details with stack traces

### 3. **Webhook Registration Utility** 🔧

#### New Tool: `src/utils/webhookRegistration.js`

**Available Commands:**
```bash
# List all webhooks
node src/utils/webhookRegistration.js list

# Register new webhook with all events
node src/utils/webhookRegistration.js register

# Update existing webhook
node src/utils/webhookRegistration.js update <notificationId>

# Delete webhook
node src/utils/webhookRegistration.js delete <notificationId>

# Get available event types
node src/utils/webhookRegistration.js event-types

# Get specific webhook details
node src/utils/webhookRegistration.js get <notificationId>
```

**Supported Events (All Configured):**
- ✅ `Paid` - Invoice fully paid
- ✅ `PartiallyPaid` - Partial payment received
- ✅ `Unpaid` - Invoice sent to customer
- ✅ `Failed` - Payment attempt failed
- ✅ `Cancelled` - Invoice cancelled
- ✅ `Voided` - Invoice voided

### 4. **Updated Services** 🛠️

#### `dynamoService.js` - New Methods:
```javascript
// Add event to history
await dynamoService.addEventToHistory(paymentLinkId, {
  eventType: 'invoice.paid',
  status: 'completed',
  description: 'Payment completed - $487.50',
  metadata: { transactionId, paymentMethod, ... }
});
```

#### `handleWebhook.js` - Enhanced Processing:
- Maps all MX Merchant events to internal statuses
- Adds detailed logging for each event type
- Records event history in DynamoDB
- Sends SMS for `completed` and `failed` statuses
- Handles `Unpaid`, `PartiallyPaid`, `Cancelled`, `Voided` events

#### `paymentLink.js` Model - New Methods:
```javascript
// Get most recent event
paymentLink.getMostRecentEvent();

// Get events by type
paymentLink.getEventsByType('invoice.paid');
```

---

## 🚀 Next Steps - How to Use

### Step 1: Register Webhook (One-Time Setup)

```bash
# List existing webhooks (if any)
node src/utils/webhookRegistration.js list

# Register new webhook with all events
node src/utils/webhookRegistration.js register
```

**Expected Output:**
```
✅ Webhook registered successfully!

📋 Notification Details:
{
  "id": 12345,
  "merchantId": 1000156972,
  "eventType": "Invoice",
  "notifyUrl": "https://mnt4wit22f.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/webhook",
  "enabled": true,
  "events": ["Paid", "PartiallyPaid", "Unpaid", "Failed", "Cancelled", "Voided"]
}

📝 Save this Notification ID for future reference: 12345
```

### Step 2: Test Webhook

#### Option A: Manual Test with Postman/curl

```bash
# 1. Create test invoice
curl -X POST https://mnt4wit22f.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/payment-links \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "amount": 10.00,
    "invoice": { "number": "TEST-001" },
    "customer": {
      "name": "Test User",
      "email": "test@example.com",
      "phone": "+13369539051"
    }
  }'

# Note the mxInvoiceId from response (e.g., 3000295)

# 2. Simulate "Paid" webhook event
curl -X POST https://mnt4wit22f.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/webhook \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "eventType": "invoice.paid",
    "invoiceId": 3000295,
    "status": "Paid",
    "invoice": {
      "id": 3000295,
      "invoiceNumber": "TEST-001",
      "status": "Paid",
      "totalAmount": 10.00,
      "paidAmount": 10.00,
      "balance": 0,
      "transactionId": "txn_test123"
    },
    "timestamp": "2025-10-10T15:00:00Z"
  }'
```

#### Option B: Real Payment Test

```bash
# 1. Create invoice (same as above)

# 2. Click payment link from response

# 3. Use test card: 4242 4242 4242 4242
#    Expiry: 12/25
#    CVV: 123

# 4. Submit payment

# 5. MX Merchant automatically sends webhook to your Lambda
```

### Step 3: Monitor Events

```bash
# View real-time logs
serverless logs -f handleWebhook --tail
```

**Look for:**
```
📥 WEBHOOK RECEIVED: Processing webhook event
✅ EVENT: Payment Completed
💾 DATABASE: Payment link status updated
📝 HISTORY: Event added to history
📱 SMS: ✅ Payment confirmation sent successfully
```

### Step 4: Check Database

**AWS Console → DynamoDB → `mx-lambda-api-dev-payment-links`**

Look for:
- ✅ `status`: `completed`
- ✅ `eventHistory`: Array with all events
- ✅ `transactionId`: Transaction ID
- ✅ `paidAmount`, `balance`, etc.

## 📊 Event Flow Example

```
1. Invoice Created
   └─> Status: "created"
   └─> eventHistory: [{ eventType: "created", status: "created", ... }]

2. MX Merchant Sends Invoice
   └─> Webhook: "Unpaid" event fires
   └─> Status: "pending"
   └─> eventHistory: [created, unpaid]
   └─> SMS: None

3. Customer Pays
   └─> Webhook: "Paid" event fires
   └─> Status: "completed"
   └─> eventHistory: [created, unpaid, paid]
   └─> SMS: "Your payment of $487.50 has been received..."

4. View History in DynamoDB
   └─> Full audit trail with timestamps, amounts, transaction IDs
```

## 🎓 Key Concepts

### Event History vs. Status

- **`status`** - Current state (e.g., `completed`)
- **`eventHistory`** - Complete audit trail of all state transitions

**Why Both?**
- Query by status: "Show me all completed payments"
- Query by history: "Show me all payments that were attempted but failed"

### Idempotency

Receiving the same webhook multiple times won't cause issues:
- ✅ Status updates are idempotent
- ✅ SMS won't be sent twice
- ✅ Event history won't have duplicates (same timestamp)

### Event Source

```javascript
source: "system"              // Created by our API
source: "mx_merchant_webhook" // Received from MX Merchant
source: "manual"              // Manual update (future feature)
```
