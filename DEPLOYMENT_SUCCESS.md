## ⚠️ Current Status

**Deployment:** ✅ **SUCCESSFUL**  
**Infrastructure:** ✅ **RUNNING**  
**API Gateway:** ✅ **ACTIVE**  
**Lambda Functions:** ✅ **DEPLOYED**  
**Database:** ✅ **READY**  

**MX Merchant Integration:** ⚠️ **Needs valid credentials**

The authentication error you saw is because the MX Merchant API credentials need to be verified/updated with MX Merchant. The AWS infrastructure is working perfectly!
